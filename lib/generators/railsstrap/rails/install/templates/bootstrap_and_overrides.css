/*
  =require bootstrap/dist/bootstrap.css
  =require bootstrap/dist/bootstrap-theme.css
  If you want exotic placement features, animations, components, and more, uncomment this:
  =require dist/railsstrap.css
  To use Font Awesome
  =require fontawesome/css/font-awesome.(min).css
  To use Gylphicons, you don't have to do anything. Bootstrap includes it by default.
